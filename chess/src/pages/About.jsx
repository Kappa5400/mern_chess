          <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p>
            This is a repo of this website that is deployed on Digital Ocean.
            Besides the normal parts of this website that are easy to see, this
            application has a fully working CI/CD pipeline that on each Github
            push will test and lints code, create a docker image for the front
            end and back ends, have a self hosted Github runner on the website
            server pull the docker images, build the images, then deploy the
            images. Testing includes unit testing of both expected failures and
            expected success of each part of the service layer and also includes
            integration testing for each used API point. The app does a couple
            of things currently: It supports account creation and login. It
            calls the Lichess daily puzzle endpoint and saves the puzzle to the
            database. It shows the last ten daily lichess puzzles. It supports a
            basic score system, solving a puzzle while logged into an account
            gives you a point. It shows the top 5 scoring users across the
            website. For logged in users it supports puzzle creation, viewing,
            and deleation. You can browse and play through all saved user
            puzzles. The purpose of this app is to showcase my software
            engineering abilities. As such, I will go through a more detailed
            overview below.

          <h2>Project Walkthrough System Architecture </h2>
          <p>
            The webapp is built with a client-server architecture, where as the
            backend is seperate from the frontend. The backend contains the
            database, mongodb in this case, the service layer, and the routing
            layer. It also contains some middleware for data validation and
            authentication, unit and integration testing, logging utlities, and
            a simple job script. The apis are accessed via the frontend's api
            handler layer which is either accessed through react hooks or
            directly in components or pages. The frontend also contains
            authentication contexts to handle tokens.

            <h2>Backend</h2>
            <p>
              The backend follows a basic database model &lt;——&lt; service
              &lt;——&lt; route pattern with some middleware for input validation
              and logging. For the actual logic, I seperated files into three
              buckets: user account logic, puzzle logic, and user made puzzle
              logic. There are 3 db models, 3 service files, and 3 route files
              setup, seperating the logic between the buckets. The user made
              puzzle has crud capabilities and expected crud endpoints which can
              be accessed on the frontend with authentication, as well as a way
              to 'publicly' view user made puzzles without authentication. The
              puzzle logic is for viewing puzzles in the frontend only, as
              puzzles are retrieved with cronjob scripts in the backend.
              Finally, the user logic has support for creating users and logging
              in to the created accounts.{" "}
            </p>
            <h3>Cron Job</h3> There are two fetch scripts to get the daily
            puzzle. runDailyFetch.js is run manually via node script calling in
            the cmd line. The other script, dailypuzzleget.js, sets up two
            cronjobs to attempt to fetch the lichess dailypuzzle. As the lichess
            dailypuzzle is not updated at the same time every day, I had to have
            two jobs setup to 'check' if the puzzle was updated or not. The
            script gets the puzzle currently in the lichess endpoint, and if it
            already matches a puzzle that is in the database, it ignores it. If
            it doesn't match, it will add it to the database, then call delete
            oldest puzzle. As this is just a toy app, it was important to make
            sure the database size was self regulated.
            <br />
            <h2>Security</h2> To support account creation and login, I used
            jsonwebtokens to track tokens during sessions, allowing for user
            authenticated required actions and page views. The passwords are
            hashed before being saved to the database and are used in the
            frontend for verification. All user input is sanatized and most are
            type validated with joi schemas. In total, this app is not
            spectacualrly security focused, but it has a basic support for
            expected website security. <br />
            <h2>Frontend</h2> The frontend uses react component based structure
            with pages, components, state hooks, and api. The flow of logic is
            as follows: pages &lt;--&lt; components &lt;--&lt; hooks &lt;--&lt;
            api Sometimes inside a component, however, I did call api functions
            instead of using hooks in the event that a state wasn't necessary.
            The frontend uses the react-chessboard library and chess.js to
            handle the chess logic and board state visualization: however, in
            order to make user created puzzles, I had to write the logic to
            input the puzzle information in the front end. The frontend also has
            token conditional pages and actions, such as creating user puzzles,
            deleting user puzzles, and viewing all self made puzzles. The
            frontend also has a page to view all user made puzzles that all uses
            can access: however, users are not able to do user restricted
            actions, such as delete those puzzles. There is also a scoreboard to
            view the top five users and their scores, you get a point for each
            puzzle you solve. <br />
            <h2>Testing, CI/CD, and Deployment</h2>
            <h3>Testing</h3>
            Testing currently includes unit testing and integration testing
            using the jest library. Unit tests make sure both expected failures
            and expected success cases are operating correctly in the logic
            layer and the integration tests make sure that the API is able to
            send data successfully. There exists unit tests for every utilized
            business logic function, both for expected passes and failures, as
            well as integration tests for each utilized API endpoint. These make
            sure that every update to the codebase will not destroy the base
            functionality of the application. <br />
            <h3>CI/CD</h3>
            CI/CD is done with GitHub actions so that each Github push will test
            and lint the backend, create new docker images on the server for the
            front end and backend, and the images will then be deployed to the
            server. On the website server there is a self-hosted GitHub runner
            that receives Github actions to pull the updated docker image from
            Dockerhub and the deploy the built images. This easy GitHub actions
            to Docker to server pipeline ensures frictionless CI/CD.
            <br />
            <h3>Deployment</h3>
            The website server is hosted through Digital Ocean, where a droplet
            is setup and configured with a self hosted GitHub runner to handle
            the CI/CD aspects of deployment. The server docker images are built
            on each GitHub push that passes linting and testing, ensuring faulty
            code is never deployed. Website IP masking and security from
            external attacks are prevented through the use of Cloudflare and a
            Digital Ocean firewall.
